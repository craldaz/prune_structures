AUTONEB Workflow

#Generate all the conformers into directory xyz/
print "Usage: python generate.py -i [xyz_file] -b [idx,idx,bond order] -t [torsion_angle_specification_file] -m [xyz modification file]  [-r] [-v] [-T [check_time]] -d [unoptimized_xyz_file_path] --no_sorting --no_opt --smi [reference smi]"
          -i   xyz file (Required)

          -r   Restart mode
          -v   Verbose output
          -m   xyz modification file
          -T   Time interval to check whether the minimization jobs 
               are finished
          -b   Bonds to be created 
          --smi reference SMILE string to prune wrong molecules
          --no_sorting: do no sort the minimized structure
          --no_opt: do not optimize the structures (usually used when we just want to create some new structures)
          --localopt: do local optimization with pybel's internal force field after doing modification to the structures (currently only works with mode=3) 

#Prune with distance spectrum 
cd xyz #Need to be in the directory xyz/ generated above with your conformers

          -e   Energy cutoff for conformers. Positive flaot (kCal/mol)   # look for second line 
          -n   Max number of clusters to be kept. Positive integer.      #
          -r   RMSD threshold for conformers within a cluster
          -a   List of aligned atoms IDs (0-indexed) seperated by comma

#Optimize the pruned conformers
cd .. #Move back to original working dir
python generate.py -d xyz -m no.mod 
        #Must have no.mod file in dir with 0 0 [eng, angles] as first line or will fail

#Prune on smiley string and use Hungarian algorithm
cd min_sorted
python ../prune_class.py -r 0.1 -m 0 --smi "SMILEY HERE"
        #For intermediates with many conformers set -n 10 for 10 clusters max
